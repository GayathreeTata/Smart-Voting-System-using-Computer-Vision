# Smart-Voting-System-using-Computer-Vision
Smart Voting System Overview

The Smart Voting System is an innovative solution that leverages "Deep learning and Computer Vision Technologies to streamline the "voting process". This project aims to enhance the security, accuracy, and efficiency of elections by automating voter identification and vote counting.

Features

Voter Identification: Uses computer vision techniques to recognize and verify voters based on facial recognition.
Secure Voting Process: Implements a secure and tamper-proof voting mechanism.
Real-Time Vote Counting: Utilizes deep learning algorithms for fast and accurate vote counting.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for voters and election officials.
Data Analytics: Offers insights and reports based on voting data.
Technologies Used

Deep Learning Frameworks: Numpy , pandas, Sk learn
Computer Vision Libraries: OpenCV
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (Flask)
Database: SQLyog

System Workflow
Voter Authentication:

1 The voter stands in front of a camera.
The system captures the voter's image and matches it against the registered database using a deep learning facial recognition model.
If authenticated, the voter is granted access to the voting system.

2 Ballot Casting:
The voter selects their candidate from a digital ballot.
The system verifies and processes the ballot using image classification models to ensure correctness.

3 Vote Submission:
Once verified, the vote is encrypted and securely transmitted to the central server for counting.
